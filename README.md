# Titanic Dataset Analysis
# Introduction
This repository contains the code and analysis for Task 2 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Info Tech. For this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, sourced from Kaggle.

# Data Descripiton
We used the titanic dataset from kaggle to perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) Data Dictionary

# Task Overview
The primary objective of this task was to conduct data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to extract insights from the Titanic dataset. This involved:
* Handling missing values and duplicates.
* Exploring relationships between key variables to identify trends and patterns.

# Data SET
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of data science. It includes detailed information about passengers aboard the Titanic, such as demographics and survival status. This dataset is frequently used for educational purposes and offers a valuable opportunity to apply various data analysis techniques.

# Conclusion
The data cleaning and exploratory data analysis performed on the Titanic dataset provided valuable insights into factors influencing survival during the Titanic disaster. This analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of historical events and demonstrates the practical application of data science techniques to derive meaningful insights from data.
